# timetable-helper
Writing this down so I don't forget:
## A script that will (hopefully) launch everyday and show me exactly what changes to my backback's content I have to make.
Example: I don't have maths on the next day, so the script will show me something like 
### math--
maybe i'll add something cleverer along the way
It would be epic if he script fetched up-to-date data about the timetable
